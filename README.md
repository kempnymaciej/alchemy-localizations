# AlchemyLocalizations
A personal project that implements a localizations system for Unity.

## Key features:
* Google sheets synchronizations
* Advanced access with static keys
* Simple configuration with a dedicated editor window
* Loading based on the addressables package

## Early beta NOTE!
The AlchemyLocalizations package is currently in an early beta stage. It is functional, but sometimes it may not work as intended and may be missing some features.
In the near future I will be working on the following:
* documentation and tutorials
* tests for different types of players (especially Android)
* better validation
